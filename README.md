# 🌐 INP Mother App – Automatic INP Layer Engine

A fully automated, intelligent Intrinsic Network Pharmacology (INP) platform to infer disease-relevant failure layers from uploaded ligand (.mol) and receptor (.pdb) structures.

---

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Upload **Ligand (.mol)** → Extract SMILES → Fetch ChEMBL targets
- ✅ Upload **Receptor (.pdb)** → Extract function keywords from structure
- ✅ Auto-generate:
  - **Layer 1:** Trigger & Collapse nodes
  - **Layer 2:** Feedback mapping
  - **Layer 3:** Redox imbalance flags
  - **Layer 4:** Immune & inflammation loops
  - **Layer 5:** Repair/autophagy influence
  - **Layer 6:** Network pharmacology therapeutic fit
