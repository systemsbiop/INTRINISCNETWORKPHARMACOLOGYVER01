## 🔬 Features

### 🧠 INP 8-Layer Simulation
Capture systems-level failure and recovery using eight scientific layers:
1. Trigger & Collapse Node Identification  
2. Feedback Loop Mapping  
3. Redox Balance & Oxidative Stress  
4. Immune & Vascular Crosstalk  
5. Autophagy & Repair  
6. Therapeutic Network Affinity  
7. Dynamic Simulation Logic  
8. Network Pharmacology Overlay

### 🧬 Docking with AutoDock Vina
- Upload receptor as `.pdb` and ligand as `.mol`
- Automatically converted to `.pdbqt` via **Open Babel**
- Docking executed using AutoDock Vina
- Outputs log and docked ligand files

### 📊 INP Summary Output
- Displays content entered in each layer  
- Simple, expandable report structure
