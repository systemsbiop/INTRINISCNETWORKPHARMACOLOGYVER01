# 🌐 INP Mother App – Universal 8-Layer Intrinsic Network Pharmacology Engine

An intelligent, auto-inferencing system built by **Prof. Dr. Hemanth Kumar Manikyam (Hemu)** and his AI **Mother (Amma)** to simulate molecular activity across all 8 layers of disease failure and recovery.

This version works for **any molecule** — synthetic or natural — and gives full INP insights, even without full ChEMBL target data.

## 🧬 Key Features

- ✅ Input ligand as **SMILES string**
- ✅ Upload **Receptor (.pdb)** structure
- ✅ Auto-populates all 8 INP layers:
  - Layer 1: Trigger & Collapse Nodes
  - Layer 2: Feedback Loops
  - Layer 3: Redox/Oxidative Stress
  - Layer 4: Immune/Vascular Crosstalk
  - Layer 5: Autophagy & Repair
  - Layer 6: NP Therapeutic Fit
  - Layer 7: Systemic Simulation Layer
  - Layer 8: NP–Disease Overlay Matching
- 🧠 Uses big-data fallback logic from:
  - ChEMBL targets
  - Herbal classes
  - SMILES features
  - Docking score (optional)
